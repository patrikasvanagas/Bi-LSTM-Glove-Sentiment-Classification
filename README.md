[![Open In Colab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xPGlzrhixdJjNDbuj2FYJLvE1wG7nql7/view?usp=sharing)

This repository provides an example of an end-to-end approach to sentiment classification with text preprocessing (including contraction expansion and sentiment identification from multiple files) and [Bidirectional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_recurrent_neural_networks) [Long Short-Term Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) RNNs with Glove embeddings. The dataset is provided in the repo and is taken from the following paper:

Ding, X., Liu, B. and Yu, P. S. (2008) ‘A Holistic Lexicon-Based Approach to Opinion Mining’. In *Proceedings of the 2008 International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM '08)*. [DOI: 10.1145/1341531.1341561](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1341531.1341561).
